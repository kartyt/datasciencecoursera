## Read Me (Getting and Cleaning Data Project)

This is the final project for Getting and Cleaning Data course. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## The script [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/kartyt/datasciencecoursera/Final_Project_Getting_and_Cleaning_Data/run_analysis.R)
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
