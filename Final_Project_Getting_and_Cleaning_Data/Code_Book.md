### Description
This is a code book containing additional information about the data and transformations used in the final project for Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### Data Source
The raw data and its description were obtained at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Raw Data Description
"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."

### Variable Used in this project Description
Column 1
Variable "Subject" presents the number of the participant

Column 2
Type of the activity

Columns from 3 to 81
In this project, the variables presents average values for each activity done by given participant. 

The measurements come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals TimeAcc-XYZ and TimeGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (TimeBodyAcc-XYZ and TimeGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (TimeBodyAccJerk-XYZ and TimeBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing FreqBodyAcc-XYZ, FreqBodyAccJerk-XYZ, FreqBodyGyro-XYZ, FreqBodyAccJerkMag, FreqBodyGyroMag, FreqBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'Freq' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are Mean (Mean value) and Std(Standard deviation)


## The script [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/kartyt/datasciencecoursera/Final_Project_Getting_and_Cleaning_Data/run_analysis.R)
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
